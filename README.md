## Hi I'm pippinsims, I like to code.

Some stuff about me:
- I’m currently working on my own personal video game 
- I’m currently completing an ECE major, but I'm also learning game dev independantly
- I’m looking to collaborate on a video game with you
- I’m looking for help with making a video game
- Ask me about Unity
- Lol 1. Yes I didn't take the time to make this README personal, but 2. I absolutely LOVE game dev, I've been learning Unity independantly since 2017.
